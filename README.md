## Overview

The Dog Adoption App is a web application built using React and Firebase to facilitate the adoption process for dogs. It leverages Firebase services such as Authentication, Firestore, and Storage to provide a seamless end-to-end experience for users.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Utilizes Firebase Authentication to allow users to create accounts, sign in, and securely manage their profiles.

- **Dog Listings:** Displays a list of available dogs for adoption, each with detailed information, including images, descriptions, and adoption status.

- **:** Uses Firebase Storage to handle image uploads for each dog, ensuring a smooth and reliable experience for users and administrators.
- 
- **Communication with Dog Owners:** Enables potential adopters to communicate with current dog owners. This feature allows users to ask questions, get insights into a dog's behavior, and receive firsthand experiences from those who have already adopted it.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
